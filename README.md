# The Bad Payment Service

On your first day in the team, you had to do a code review on our Payment System service. This system processes payments with multiple available methods.

The code requires significant improvements to improve maintainability, readability and reusability.

Fork this repository and suggest the improvements on the following classes:

1 - _PaymentService_. The code in this class is not very extensible, and there are several code smells. Identify them and propose a refactoring approach.

2 - _AsynchronousPaymentService_. Use your knowledge of reactive patterns to refactor this class by applying an appropriate pattern.

Please, do not use any external library/framework (e.g: Spring). You must improve the code using only Java.

For both scenarios provide the appropriate level of unit testing.
